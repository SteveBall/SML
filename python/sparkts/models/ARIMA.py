"""
ARIMA models allow modeling timeseries as a function of prior values of the series
(i.e. autoregressive terms) and a moving average of prior error terms. ARIMA models
are traditionally specified as ARIMA(p, d, q), where p is the autoregressive order,
d is the differencing order, and q is the moving average order. Using the backshift (aka
lag operator) B, which when applied to a Y returns the prior value, the
ARIMA model can be specified as
Y_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^p \phi_i*B^i*Y_t + \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i*B^i*\epsilon_t + \epsilon_t
where Y_i has been differenced as appropriate according to order `d`
See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average]] for more
information on ARIMA.
See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_integration]] for more information on differencing
integrated time series.

def autofit(ts, maxp=5, maxd=2, maxq=5, sc=None):
    """
    Utility function to help in fitting an automatically selected ARIMA model based on approximate
    Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values. The model search is based on the heuristic
    developed by Hyndman and Khandakar (2008) and described in [[http://www.jstatsoft
    .org/v27/i03/paper]]. In contrast to the algorithm in the paper, we use an approximation to
    the AIC, rather than an exact value. Note that if the maximum differencing order provided
    does not suffice to induce stationarity, the function returns a failure, with the appropriate
    message. Additionally, note that the heuristic only considers models that have parameters
    satisfying the stationarity/invertibility constraints. Finally, note that our algorithm is
    slightly more lenient than the original heuristic. For example, the original heuristic
    rejects models with parameters "close" to violating stationarity/invertibility. We only
    reject those that actually violate it.
   
    This functionality is even less mature than some of the other model fitting functions here, so
    use it with caution.
   
    Parameters
    ----------
    ts:
        time series to which to automatically fit an ARIMA model as a Numpy array
    maxP:

    """
    Given a time series, fit a non-seasonal ARIMA model of order (p, d, q), where p represents
    the autoregression terms, d represents the order of differencing, and q moving average error
    terms. If includeIntercept is true, the model is fitted with an intercept. In order to select
    the appropriate order of the model, users are advised to inspect ACF and PACF plots, or compare
    the values of the objective function. Finally, while the current implementation of
    `fitModel` verifies that parameters fit stationarity and invertibility requirements,
    there is currently no function to transform them if they do not. It is up to the user
    to make these changes as appropriate (or select a different model specification)

    Parameters

    method:
        objective function and optimization method, current options are 'css-bobyqa',

        conditional sum of squares. The first uses BOBYQA for optimization, while
        the second uses conjugate gradient descent. Default is 'css-cgd'
    userInitParams:
        A set of user provided initial parameters for optimization as a float list.
        If null (default), initialized using Hannan-Rissanen algorithm. If provided,
        order of parameter should be: intercept term, AR parameters (in
        increasing order of lag), MA parameters (in increasing order of lag).
