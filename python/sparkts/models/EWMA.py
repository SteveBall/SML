"""
Fits an Exponentially Weight Moving Average model (EWMA) (aka. Simple Exponential Smoothing) to
a time series. The model is defined as S_t = (1 - a) * X_t + a * S_{t - 1}, where a is the
smoothing parameter, X is the original series, and S is the smoothed series. For more
information, please see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing.

def fit_model(ts, sc=None):
    """
    Fits an EWMA model to a time series. Uses the first point in the time series as a starting
    value. Uses sum squared error as an objective function to optimize to find smoothing parameter
    The model for EWMA is recursively defined as S_t = (1 - a) * X_t + a * S_{t-1}, where
    a is the smoothing parameter, X is the original series, and S is the smoothed series
    Note that the optimization is performed as unbounded optimization, although in its formal
    definition the smoothing parameter is <= 1, which corresponds to an inequality bounded
    optimization. Given this, the resulting smoothing parameter should always be sanity checked

        the time series to which we want to fit an EWMA model as a Numpy array
